Step 1: Random number from filename.
Step 2: Annotate and subpx_bias 5 random frames.
Step 3: Repeat until good (subpx_bias no dip by increasing particle diameter, no false positives on minmass parameter (enough data to compensate for edge cases)).
Step 4: Run analysis on entire video and save batch, link, msd, and diffusion coefficient data to file.
Step 5: Analyse results and calculate final diffusion coefficient.
I think this is pretty good? Let's just start and see what happens.

Load frames every time.
While tuning:
    load frames (don't cache, the cache file is much bigger than the original wmv, I don't want to cycle my drive like that).
    generate 5 random numbers from filename
    annotate 5 frames, try to subpx_bias the same 5 frames, plot those in columns per frame

I want to load the data in another file.
Function load_video("video.wmv") loads the frames from a video file.
Function load_batch_cache("cache/batch/video_batch_data.pickle") attempts to load data, and if not exists or fails to load, returns false, else true and data.
Function load_link_cache("cache/link/video_link_data.pickle") attempts to load data, and if not exists or fails to load, returns false, else true and data.
Use force_regenerate parameter in main function to disable cache loading.

Implemented new data loader module, which does exactly that. I seem to be pretty slow today.

Some weird errors, small break.
