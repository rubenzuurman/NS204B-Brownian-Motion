Analyzed first 600 frames of test_13_09_2024_05.wmv and plotted a mass vs size graph (log/test_13_09_2024_05_frame0to599_mass_vs_size.png) and the trajectories using the tp.plot_traj() function (log/test_13_09_2024_05_frame0to599_trajectories.png).
16.04
Committed changes, which includes linking of the data, then plotting mass vs size and plotting trajectories.

16.29
Split data loading and generating code into multiple functions to make it more readable.
Side note: Generating batch data for 600 frames (30 seconds) to data takes about 2 minutes.
16.32
Another side note: Frames 222-224 have 3 or 4 trajectories, but the rest of the frames have 13+, this needs to be checked at some point.
16.36
The last frame of the video is now saved in grayscale as 'grayscale_frame.png' (example in log/test_13_09_2024_05_lastframe_grayscale.png).
16.45
Restructured the main file code a little bit more.
I contemplate abstracting the plotting code into it's own function as well, because it clutters the main code quite a lot.
16.54
Restructured the code even more, generating batch data and generating link data now have their own functions.
17.01
Removed two functions that where called exactly once and consisted of two lines each.
