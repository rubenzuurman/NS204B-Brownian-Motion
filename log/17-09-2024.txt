Analyzed first 600 frames of test_13_09_2024_05.wmv and plotted a mass vs size graph (log/test_13_09_2024_05_frame0to599_mass_vs_size.png) and the trajectories using the tp.plot_traj() function (log/test_13_09_2024_05_frame0to599_trajectories.png).
16.04
Committed changes, which includes linking of the data, then plotting mass vs size and plotting trajectories.

16.29
Split data loading and generating code into multiple functions to make it more readable.
Side note: Generating batch data for 600 frames (30 seconds) to data takes about 2 minutes.
16.32
Another side note: Frames 222-224 have 3 or 4 trajectories, but the rest of the frames have 13+, this needs to be checked at some point.
16.36
The last frame of the video is now saved in grayscale as 'grayscale_frame.png' (example in log/test_13_09_2024_05_lastframe_grayscale.png).
16.45
Restructured the main file code a little bit more.
I contemplate abstracting the plotting code into it's own function as well, because it clutters the main code quite a lot.
16.54
Restructured the code even more, generating batch data and generating link data now have their own functions.
17.01
Removed two functions that where called exactly once and consisted of two lines each.

17.08
Committed the code cleanup changes.
Also discovered a bug while testing AFTER committing (for some reason I had not run the code before committing): saving of batch- and linkdata failed because I forgot to change a variable name. This is now fixed.
17.12
Fixed a warning message from a function mostly copied from the trackpy source.
~17.13
Commit changes relating to fixing bugs.

17.25
Calculated drift from dataset, but this is not linear in time or something (see plot in log/test_13_09_2024_05_frame0to599_drift.png). Saved the trajectories with drift subtracted to log/test_13_09_2024_05_frame0to599_trajectories_no_drift.png). I don't know if this is a bad sign, since the walkthrough suggests that the drift may be linear. However, the drift I observe is small (especially the y component) compared to their drift, so maybe it's fine.
17.42
Calculated mean squared distance for every particle and plotted mean squared distance vs lag time (I don't know what this means).
I've also looked again at the 'data/13_09_2024_06_good.wmv', and it should be doable. If I can distinguish the particles, the computer should be able to as well, given the correct settings. It also contains way more particles, so that should make the statistics work much better.
17.46
I just realized the settings need to be customizable easily, and I don't know if they currently are.
17.49
Change some of the analysis settings to global variables in analysis.py, I may change this later.
17.50 End

19.36
Add more global variables. Added comments to global variables.
