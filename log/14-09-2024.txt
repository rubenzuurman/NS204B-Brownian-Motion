Pip install trackpy and deps.
Commit elementary code to github together with requirements.txt and data (I know you're not supposed to commit binaries but it's whatever, they're small (<2MB)).

Pip install pims, moviepy.

Getting the following error currently:
    We had to kill ffmpeg to stop it.

I don't know why this is happening.
Doesn't matter which one of the 6 files I choose.
Pip installed opencv-python just to be sure.

Able to load video frames using cv2.
Converted first frame to grayscale and saved as png.

21.01
Ref for video loading using cv2: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21669632/how-do-i-open-wmv-files-with-opencv-on-mac

21.03
Committed video loading code.

21.12
Implemented caching of data to save some time on loading the data, but the cache file of a 2MB wmv is 570MB, so this will only increase load on ssd, which I don't think is worth it for 1-2 seconds per run.
In short: not doing caching.

21.21
Trackpy.locate seems to return a dataframe with potential particle positions (parameters to be tuned).
Trackpy.annotate returns an Axes object (e.g. 'Axes(0.125,0.11;0.775x0.77)'), but I can't seem to figure out what I'm supposed to do with the axes object, or what is represents.

21.29
Particle mass represents how contrasty the particle is it seems. I still gotta figure out how to actually plot the results of annotate().
Gonna take a break now.

21.39 Start
tp.annotate has an 'ax' parameter, which I'm gonna try now.
21.41
It works [log/Screenshot 2024-09-14 214205.png].
21.53
Committed visualising tp.locate().
To do next time: tp.batch() on subset of frames to test. Done for today.
