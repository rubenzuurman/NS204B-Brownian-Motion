Second argument to tp.locate() is estimated particle size in pixels.
    9 seems to work, but I'll leave it at 11 to be on the safe side (as suggested in the walkthrough)

Set pandas options to print full dataframe instead of three dots in the middle.

Got plot of hist of tp.subpx_bias() working by copying it and adding an 'ax' parameter to the function, since the df.hist() function accepts an 'ax' parameter.
However, since the number of particles is very small, the histogram does not have a clear shape, so a dip could not be seen. [log/test_13_09_2024_05_frame0_minmass600_hist.png]

tp.batch(frames[0]) crashed my pc big time. All chrome windows are unresponsive, there's an extra window with the title 'chrome.exe - Application Error'. No clue what to do now.

Restarted pc and chrome is restored. I'm thinking of running it in a sandbox environment to prevent this from happening.

Ran the project inside windows sandbox. It gave some error about 'DLL could not be loaded' -> 'pip install msvc-runtime' outside of venv solves it. Then it crashed with some 'Page file too small' error with a lot of threadpool/worker messages indicating multithreading. I've now set 'processes=1' in tp.batch() in the hope that it solves the issue.
It solved the issue.

Works on main machine as well. I comtemplate caching the dataframe returned by tp.batch().

Implemented caching mechanism in src/cache.py. It saves a bit of time with the tp.batch() command.
